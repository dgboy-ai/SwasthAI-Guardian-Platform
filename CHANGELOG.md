## [v2.5.0] - 2026-06-03
### Added
- **ASHA-to-PHC Referral Outcomes**: Integrated closed-loop tracking fields (`outcome`, `outcome_details`, `closed_at`) to fully close the care referral loop.
- **Mission Indradhanush Immunization Tracking**: Created a child vaccination tracking system (`vaccination_records` table) for monitoring scheduled vs administered shots.
- **ASHA Performance Dashboard**: Exposed aggregated KPIs (completed referrals, pregnancies tracked, vaccinations, emergency alerts) per worker for CMO district metrics.
- **Security Audit Logging**: Created asynchronous Express middleware (`backend/middleware/audit.js`) to capture access and updates on sensitive database endpoints.
- **District Config Settings**: Created a per-district threshold override database (`district_config`) allowing CMOs to toggles auto-ambulances and override contact numbers.
- **SQLite Database Auto-Migrations**: Implemented SQLite-specific dynamic column check and alter migrations in `backend/db/schema.js` to ensure older local development sqlite databases auto-update cleanly on reboot.
- **DynamoDB GSI Query Route**: Built `GET /api/admin/outbreaks/disease-search` executing QueryCommand against `disease-index` GSI.
- **Offline Sync-Health Logger**: Added `POST /api/villager/sync-health` logging sync telemetry to DynamoDB.
- **Mental Health PHQ-2 Screener**: Added `POST /api/villager/phq2` triage screener that auto-creates urgent ASHA referrals on depression risk.
- **QR-Code Scan Login**: Added passwordless `POST /api/auth/qr-login` allowing auth by scanning Aadhaar or Village Card QR payloads.
